## API Rules (21 Collections)

### Pattern: Coach Access
```javascript
// Coach sees only their data:
@request.auth.id = coach_id

// Coach sees athlete data through group membership:
@request.auth.id = athlete_id.coach_id
```

### Pattern: Athlete Access
```javascript
// Athlete sees only own data:
@request.auth.id = athlete_id

// Athlete reads plans published to their group:
@request.auth.id != "" && 
  group_id.group_members_via_group_id.athlete_id ?= @request.auth.id
```

### Pattern: Admin Only
```javascript
// error_logs, audit_log — no client access:
// List/Create/Update/Delete rules: "" (empty = denied)
// Admin-only via PocketBase Admin UI
```
